Hi there, I'm creator of this game. I'm now working on C version so Java ver coms after C. Thanks for understanding, have fun, bye :)

Hello,
You can play a game if you open hashNcode.

Principle:
Program randomly choose hash. Hash is a code that contains only 0-9 numbers. You're trying to guess the combination.

Rules:
Write your attempts in this format: for 3 "# # #", for 5 "# # # # #", etc.
Program shows you, how good you are in guessing.
C - your number is on this position;
O - your number is in hash but not on this position;
F - your number is not in hash;
Program is counting your attempts.

Guide:
In menu type
1 - for start game
2 - for checking Rules
3 - for exit
After start type any number. If you type 3, you will trying to guess the 3-numbered hash, if you type 10, you will guess 10-numbered hash etc.
In Rules type 0 for return into menu, otherwise program ends.
